# LIBERO-MAX Paper Plan

> **Historical v1 paper plan.** The status, model counts, and proposed tracks
> below record the earlier pilot and Core studies. The current paper reports
> fourteen policies on 8,000 matched pairs, with an 800-pair Lite subset. See
> the [current results](../README.md#results) and
> [benchmark specification](BENCHMARK_SPEC.md).

Status: Track A Physical Core and Track B Intent Core evaluations are complete
for Cosmos Policy Predict2-2B and pi0.5-LIBERO. The query-interval and explicit
notification ablations are also complete. Track C remains outside v1 because a
model-agnostic abstention interface is not yet available.

The five-case pilot centers on three intuitive stressors. The v1 paper main
track expands to six: illumination, camera shift, target relocation,
receptacle relocation, five-object distractor burst, and path-obstacle
insertion. Observation, clutter, and obstacle families start from three
deterministic draws per task; relocation uses fixed 6 cm and 12 cm tiers, and
the frozen release retains only configurations that pass physical preflight.

## Central question

Do VLA policies appropriately revise their behavior when an external change is
introduced after execution begins, and which kinds of changes expose the
largest gap between static task competence and mid-execution responsiveness?

## Benchmark tracks

| Track | Families | Correctness signal | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A. Physical adaptation | `OBS`, `GEO`, `CLUTTER`, `OBSTACLE` | original LIBERO goal completion, paired against no-change control | 1,335/1,335 Core pairs complete for both models; 100% trigger coverage |
| B. Intent revision | `INTENT` | alternate goal predicate or frozen ten-step safe-stop contract | 96/96 Core pairs complete for both models; 100% trigger coverage |
| C. Feasibility awareness | `FEAS` | safe abstention plus explicit infeasibility report | taxonomy only; action/text protocol and scorer missing |

Track A is the first empirical paper milestone. Track B and C must not reuse
ordinary LIBERO task success as their correctness label.

## Proposed contributions

1. A matched, deterministic protocol that isolates the effect of a change from
   base-task competence and rollout randomness.
2. A taxonomy spanning observation, geometry, obstruction, intent, and
   feasibility changes with response-mode-aware scoring.
3. A diagnostic decomposition into preserved success, recovery, regression,
   and persistent failure, with coverage and category-level uncertainty.
4. A cross-model study of two frozen VLA policies plus controlled
   query-interval and evaluator-provided event-notification diagnostics.

## Experimental design

- Use exact `(suite, task, initial-state, policy-seed)` matching across arms.
- Calibrate low/medium/high severities so each change is visible and physically
  valid without causing simulator instability.
- Place interventions at semantic triggers and explicitly measure any delay to
  the next policy query; later ablations cover early, middle, and late timing.
- Use target-proximity triggers for the core pilot and report both the physical
  change step and the next policy-query step; later timing ablations vary the
  distance threshold.
- Report full manifest coverage, invalid cases, paired flips, Wilson intervals,
  paired-bootstrap intervals, and exact McNemar tests.
- Separate change detection, response latency, final correctness, and safety.
- Verify exact pre-change action-chunk equality and report the first post-event
  action-chunk difference. This is behavioral-response evidence, not by itself
  proof of successful adaptation.

## Main tables

1. Overall paired outcome by model and benchmark track.
2. Breakdown by change family, severity, and timing.
3. Control-correct subset regression and recovery analysis.
4. Response latency and safety measurement coverage.
5. Ablations: closed-loop query interval and explicit change notification on
   one frozen, balanced 180-pair subset.

## Claim gates

- No aggregate model ranking before every planned pair is complete or declared
  invalid under a pre-specified rule.
- No adaptation claim from goal preservation alone; show behavior or action
  change conditioned on the intervention and report latency coverage.
- No safety claim when collision/stop instrumentation coverage is incomplete.
- No intent or infeasibility score from the original LIBERO `done` predicate.

## Immediate empirical ladder

1. Five-case Cosmos physical pilot on one task and one initial state. **Done.**
2. Calibrate 1,521 candidate physical scenarios and preflight them in MuJoCo.
   **Done.**
3. Exclude failed task--change--draw configurations, re-preflight 1,335/1,335,
   and freeze matched Core/Full v1.0.0. **Done.**
4. Evaluate Physical Core with Cosmos Policy Predict2-2B and pi0.5-LIBERO.
   **Done: 1,335/1,335 pairs per model.**
5. Evaluate a balanced 180-pair Cosmos subset at q16 and q5, then add the
   event-notified q16 diagnostic. **Done.**
6. Evaluate the 96-pair Intent Core without reusing the original LIBERO success
   predicate for the changed arm. **Done: 96/96 pairs per model.**
